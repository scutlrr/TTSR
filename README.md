# TTSR
Official PyTorch implementation of the paper [Learning Texture Transformer Network for Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04139) accepted in CVPR 2020.

## Requirements and dependencies
* python 3.7 (recommend to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/))
* python packages: `pip install numpy opencv-python`
* pytorch >= 1.1.0
* torchvision >= 0.4.0

## Model
Pre-trained models can be downloaded from [onedrive](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ajav6U_IU-1gmHZstHQxOTn9MLPh?e=e06Q7A), [baidu cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1j9swBtz14WneuMYgTLkWtA)(0u6i), [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CTm-r3hSbdYVCySuQ27GsrqXhhVOS-qh?usp=sharing).
* *TTSR-rec.pt*: trained with only reconstruction loss
* *TTSR.pt*: trained with all losses

## Quick test
1. Clone this github repo
```
git clone https://github.com/FuzhiYang/TTSR.git
cd TTSR
```
2. Download pre-trained models and modify "model_path" in test.sh
3. Run test
```
sh test.sh
```
4. The results are in "save_dir" (default: `./test/demo/output`)

## Evaluation
1. Download [CUFED](http://acsweb.ucsd.edu/~yuw176/event-curation.html) dataset and modify "dataset_dir" in eval.sh
2. Download pre-trained models and modify "model_path" in eval.sh
3. Run evaluation
```
sh eval.sh
```
4. The results are in "save_dir" (default: `./eval/CUFED/TTSR`)

## Train
1. Download [CUFED](http://acsweb.ucsd.edu/~yuw176/event-curation.html) dataset and modify "dataset_dir" in train.sh
2. Run training
```
sh train.sh
```
3. The training results are in "save_dir" (default: `./train/CUFED/TTSR`)
